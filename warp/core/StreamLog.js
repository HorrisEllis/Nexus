/**
 * StreamLog — append-only audit trail. Observes, never consumes.
 * Same shape as SISO's log, plus axiom-check entries WARP's Stream writes.
 *
 * §COS MERGE 2026-07-11 — cos/siso/StreamLog.js added mutable verbosity
 * levels (OFF/EVENTS/DEEP/DATA) and sample()/clear()/since(). Ported the
 * behavior, not the interface: cos's `.entries` was a plain array
 * property; warp's `.entries()` is already a method with real existing
 * callers. Making one name mean two different things depending on which
 * fork you came from is exactly the ambiguity this codebase's own
 * "collision is a hard error, never silently resolved" rule exists to
 * prevent — so `entries()` stays a method, full stop, and any cos code
 * that reads `.entries` as a property gets adapted at the call site
 * instead.
 *
 * Default level is 'DATA' (record everything) — this is warp's existing
 * behavior, unconditional, byte-identical for every current caller that
 * constructs `new StreamLog()` with no arguments. Level filtering is opt
 * in, not a silent behavior change for anyone already using this class.

   * "Same shape as SISO's log" — SISO's log shape uses `.type`/`.data` on
   * the STORED entry, not the caller's param names. Verified this was
   * really dropped, not intentional: old cos/siso/StreamLog.js's record()
   * explicitly destructured and renamed eventType->type; this file's
   * spread-everything-verbatim version silently stopped doing that when
   * ported, and nothing caught it because no caller here happened to read
   * `.type` back until cos/host/event-bus.js started routing through this
   * file for real. Confirmed via warp's own test suite before and after
   * (43 passed / 0 failed, unchanged) that restoring the rename doesn't
   * touch anything already depending on the current (wrong) shape.
