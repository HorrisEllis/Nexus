# Node type → system map — Architect

## Legend
WRITES / READS / VIA LOOM / PARTICIPATES / NOT USED — same as Guardian/Versionium.

| Type | Status | Grounding |
|---|---|---|
| `capability` | WRITES | `architect/registry-components.js`, same `_c()` convention. |
| `command` | WRITES | Same registry, route-shaped entries. |
| `component` | VIA LOOM | Confirmed — `'architect'` is in `capability-map.js`'s real `SYSTEMS` map. |
| `hook` | VIA LOOM | Same scan. |
| `wire` | VIA LOOM | Same scan. |
| `node` | VIA LOOM | Same scan. |
| `spec` | WRITES | `architect/spec/architect.spec`. Real entry point is `/ui/spec-builder`, not `/` — already known from `copilot/intents.js`'s own `LANDING_PATHS` override, confirmed cross-referenced rather than re-derived. |
| `system` | IS ONE | `architect` is a real, named system in `NEXUS_MAP.md` and `capability-map.js`'s `SYSTEMS` map. |
| Everything else in the 32 | NOT CHECKED EXHAUSTIVELY | Not swept for every remaining type this pass. |
