//   loop     = a_component_that_repeats
//   flow     = a_directed_path_a_signal_takes
// and DOMAIN 8 — LENS:

// THE LOOP THIS PROJECT IS BUILT AROUND
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// rfr2 observes  — a lens. maps conditions and relations. never gates,
//                   never creates, only annotates what's already there.
// CFR creates    — a gate. turns Observation into Structure: computes
//                   sigma, delta, gap, resonance from what rfr2 saw.
// feedback-loop-buffer — CFR's output becomes rfr2's next input. This is
//                   the literal mechanism of Emerge's `feedback` primitive:
//                   without something holding the window between what was
//                   just created and what gets observed next, there is no
//                   loop — only a one-shot pipe.
