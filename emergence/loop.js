/**
 * loop.js — assembles the five components into the actual loop
 * emergence.spec declares:
 *
 *   rfr2-observer (Lens, observes)
 *     -> feedback-loop-buffer (Signal, holds the window)
 *       -> cfr-creator (Gate, creates structure)
 *         -> associative-lattice   (Record)
 *         -> causal-graph          (Record)
 *         -> event-ledger          (Record, now durable via Jaa)
 *
 * Each arrow is a real WARP Stream.emit() call, not a metaphor. Record
 * layer runs all three in parallel — none of them feed back into the
 * loop themselves (§10.2: projections are derived, never written to
 * directly, and never re-observed as if they were new input).
 *
 * FEEDBACK, ACTUALLY WIRED NOW: feedback-loop-buffer isn't just storage
 * anymore. If tick() is called without an explicit target, the target
 * from the most recent tick is reused — the previous cycle's output
 * (what it was creating toward) becomes this cycle's input, per
 * Emerge's own `feedback = an_output_that_becomes_an_input`. Call
 * tick(text) repeatedly after one tick(text, target) call and the loop
 * keeps pursuing that target without the caller re-stating it every time.
 *
 * event-ledger is now durable across restarts (Jaa-backed FileStore +
 * FileRefs, hash-chained) — loop.history(n) walks the real persisted
 * chain, not just this session's in-memory events.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP: observerStream.pending and creatorStream.pending (WARP's own
 * bookkeeping for events with no matching gate) grow unboundedly across
 * ticks — nothing here clears them. Fine for a session of the length this
 * was tested at; a long-running process would need a pruning strategy.
 * Not addressed here because the fix belongs at the WARP Stream level (a
 * generic concern, not specific to this loop) or needs a decision on
 * what's safe to discard — not something to silently trim without that
 * decision being made deliberately.
 * WARP lives at ../warp — a sibling of this project, the foundation
 * everything here is built ON, not a vendored copy inside it. (An
 * earlier pass had it nested as emergence/warp/, which only contained
 * core/ and silently dropped WARP's dispatch/, plugins/, and its own
 * test suite. Fixed — full package restored, correctly positioned.)
