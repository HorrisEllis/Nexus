/**
 * cfr-creator — REBUILT. The first version injected stress using a made-up
 * formula (rupture*2000 + decay*800) and called that "creation" — it
 * wasn't. This version uses physics.js's actual attractor/cluster
 * mechanism, which is the real primitive for "creating toward something":
 *
 *   world.attractors — gravitational pull points (id, x, y, z, mass).
 *   world.clusters   — computed by the real _detectClusters(): density of
 *                       particles converged near an attractor, their
 *                       avgSpeed, and a sig classification ('causal' =
 *                       settled/low-speed, 'laminar' = mid, 'turb' =
 *                       still chaotic).
 *
 * CFR creates TOWARD something — an end-state, an idea, or a person —
 * per your answer. That target is never guessed here: the caller passes
 * it explicitly as `target: { id, type: 'end-state'|'idea'|'person' }`.
 * No target, no attractor, no directed creation — the field still runs
 * (curl noise, entropy) but nothing is claimed to converge toward
 * anything, which is the honest state when there's nothing to converge
 * toward.
 *
 * STATED ASSUMPTION (not hidden): an attractor's (x,y,z) position is a
 * deterministic hash of its id — there's no semantic embedding model
 * available here, so "distance to attractor" is not semantic similarity.
 * What density/convergence measures is real: whether repeated pulls
 * toward the same target actually cause the field to settle there over
 * time. That's a genuine physical signal, just not a semantic one.
