/**
 * pattern-engine -- NEW component, not a port, built in response to a
 * direct request for "a pattern engine, with pattern memory." Checked
 * real code first rather than inventing from nothing: found
 * `PredictiveEngine` in scanners/crystalball-test-suite.html (a real,
 * small Markov transition-frequency tracker -- given what just
 * happened, what usually follows, based on real observed counts). That
 * primitive is genuinely missing from Emergence and is the real basis
 * for this component's prediction half. Its `AssociationEngine`
 * sibling in the same file was NOT used -- it overlaps with what
 * associative-lattice already does (Jaccard similarity of extracted
 * content), and the file's GPGPU audio/video processors are out of
 * scope entirely (text-only pipeline).
 *
 * Two things a "pattern engine with memory" could mean were explicitly
 * separated: prediction and recall are built here. Rule generation
 * (patterns compiling into new detection code that runs itself) is
 * `forge`'s territory -- flagged earlier as a different risk category,
 * not touched without explicit sign-off, which hasn't been given.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES:
 *   signature(tickResult) -> a real, stated fingerprint of a tick:
 *     trajectory, rupture (bool), decay band, convergence state, and
 *     WHICH of the 10 observer signals fired (by key, not value) --
 *     richer than associative-lattice's own invariant set (which
 *     doesn't track which gap signals fired), built for pattern
 *     recognition specifically rather than resonance weighting.
 *
 *   recall: has this EXACT signature occurred before? Real match, not
 *     fuzzy similarity (Jaccard-style fuzzy matching is
 *     associative-lattice's job, not duplicated here). Returns the real
 *     occurrence count and which prior nodeIds it matched.
 *
 *   prediction: given the current signature, what signature has
 *     historically followed it, and how often -- real transition
 *     counts, not a guess.
 *
 * Persisted differently than the append-only chains elsewhere in this
 * project (ledger/lattice/causal-graph): pattern memory is AGGREGATE
 * mutable state (counts, not an immutable sequence of records), so it's
 * stored as one current-state blob via Jaa's FileStore + FileRefs
 * (content-addressed, but write-through on every observation rather
 * than hash-chained) -- a different, still-real use of the same
 * persistence primitives, not a new storage style invented from scratch.
