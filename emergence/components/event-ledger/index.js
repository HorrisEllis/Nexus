/**
 * event-ledger -- WARP wiring around the real, unmodified
 * vendor/rfr2/ledger/index.js FOR VALIDATION, and the real, ported
 * vendor/jaa/{FileStore,FileRefs} FOR DURABILITY.
 *
 * Two real gaps this closes:
 *   1. vendor/rfr2's ledger was in-memory only -- checked its source,
 *      zero file I/O. Every commit died with the process.
 *   2. Nothing exposed the accumulated history -- loop.js only ever
 *      returned per-tick deltas.
 *
 * Design: rfr2's real UpgradeLedger still does the actual validation
 * (requires proof, assigns real ids) -- that logic isn't replaced.
 * Every validated commit is ALSO written to Jaa's FileStore
 * (content-addressed, hash-chained via a `prev` pointer -- git-commit
 * shaped) and a FileRefs pointer `emergence/ledger/head` is advanced to
 * the new hash. That's genuine cross-restart durability, and
 * history(n) can now walk the real chain back from head.
