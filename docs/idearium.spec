    purpose: >
      The idea manager and project repository. Every build starts here
      as a seed idea and progresses through phases.
      The Spatial lattice builds a resonance-weighted graph connecting
      ideas to specs to gaps. High-weight edges = strong association.

  core:
    schemas:
      - Idea:    "{ uuid, text, phase, tags, specRef, gapScore, weight, ts }"
      - Project: "{ uuid, name, phase, specFile, artifacts[], gaps[], ts }"
    phases: [seed, expanding, tensioned, specced, building, complete]
    axioms: [AX-001, AX-002, AX-003, AX-007, AX-008]
    constants:
      LATTICE_THRESHOLD:  0.65   # minimum edge weight to cluster
      PHASE_TRANSITIONS:  "seed→expanding→tensioned→specced→building→complete"

  # ── AX-008 (foundation addendum v1.1.0) ────────────────────────────────────
  # ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-29 — idearium/index.js's _broadcast() pushes every
  # os.emit() to all SSE clients on GET /sse. copilot/server.js had an
  # IDR_URL constant declared since at least v3 but never connected to it —
  # scoped, never wired. Added _connectIdeariumStream() (same pattern as
  # _connectCortexStream/_connectGuardianStream), wired into copilot's boot
  # sequence, and added hooks/idearium.hooks.js's 4th entry
  # (idearium-to-copilot, seam:idearium-copilot-bridge) so the wire is
  # registry-visible, not just code. idea/project/lattice activity now
  # reaches copilot live.

## ADDENDUM 2026-10-10 — 0.56.0 SD1: versions and rewind on the repo's box (docs/2026-10-10-idearium-solid-phasemap.spec)
James: "can you add the rewind engine controls and versioning to the repos box you click on to open it."
- `idearium/ui/js/repo-card-time.js` puts **⟲ versions** on each box in the Repos grid and on each row of the open repo's list. It shows the last three versions, each with ↶ (the real restore preview, rendered inside the box), the desktop's pause, resume and checkpoint, and its last checkpoints with ↶ rewind.
- It uses the same routes as the Plan panel. `previewRepoRestore(uuid, commitId, outId)` and `rtRewind(tag, uuid)` now take the repo, so they work outside the open repo.

## ADDENDUM 2026-10-10 — 0.57.0 OP2–OP4: a system's options and Environment & desktop (docs/2026-10-10-shape-of-nexus-phasemap.spec)
- `GET/POST /api/systems/:system/options` forwards to that system's own `/api/options` (the port comes from nexus-config ports). A system that declares no options yet says so.
- The settings console gives each `nexus/<system>` repo a System tab.
- `idearium options <system> [<group.key> <value> | --reset] [--actor copilot]` is in the one command table.
- Repo Settings: Environment and Desktop are one item. The desktop's buttons follow `/api/cos/testenv` vm.ok and its state (OP4).
